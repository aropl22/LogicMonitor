Repository Structure
This repository is organized into two main folders based on script type:

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ps/      # PowerShell scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ py/      # Python scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sdt_params.json  # Example configuration file
üîπ ps/ ‚Äì PowerShell Scripts
Contains PowerShell scripts used for interacting with the LogicMonitor API, including scheduling downtime (SDT). These scripts rely on the Logic.Monitor module and may use a JSON file for parameters.

Example: build-sdt.ps1

üîπ py/ ‚Äì Python Scripts
Includes optional helper scripts written in Python for tasks such as data manipulation, file preparation, or integration with other tools.

Example: prepare-devices.py

Organizing scripts this way keeps language-specific logic cleanly separated and easier to maintain.
Let me know if you'd like to include example content from each folder.
